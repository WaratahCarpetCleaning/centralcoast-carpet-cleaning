          <h2 id="about-heading">Central Coast's Local Carpet Cleaning Specialists</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Terry — founder and lead technician at Central Coast Carpet Cleaning. I've been cleaning carpets professionally for over 15 years, serving thousands of homes and businesses right here on the Central Coast.</p>
          <p>What started as a simple mission — to give Central Coast families genuinely clean, safe carpets — has grown into one of the Coast's most trusted cleaning services. We're not a franchise or call centre. When you book with us, you get me.</p>
          <p>I'm passionate about eco-friendly cleaning. Every product I use is biodegradable and non-toxic, because I believe your family and our environment deserve better than harsh chemicals. The results speak for themselves — carpets that look and smell clean, with nothing harmful left behind.</p>

This means more power, faster drying, and deeper cleaning than consumer-grade machines can achieve.</p>
          <p style="color:var(--green-200);margin-bottom:32px;line-height:1.8;">Our equipment reaches temperatures that kill dust mites, bacteria and allergens — leaving your carpets genuinely clean, not just surface-clean.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer-inner">Steam cleaning (hot water extraction) injects heated water deep into carpet fibres and extracts it — along with embedded dirt, bacteria and allergens. It's the most thorough method available. Dry cleaning uses a low-moisture compound that captures dirt and is vacuumed away — ideal for delicate carpets or when fast drying is essential. We assess your carpet and recommend the best method for your situation.</div>
